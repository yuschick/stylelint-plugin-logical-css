Stylelint Plugin Logical CSS aims to enforce the use of logical CSS properties,
values and units. The plugin provides two rules. But first, let's get set up.

## Getting Started

> Before getting started with the plugin, you must first have
> [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) version 14.0.0 or greater installed

To get started using the plugin, it must first be installed.

```bash
npm i stylelint-plugin-logical-css --save-dev
```

```bash
yarn add stylelint-plugin-logical-css --dev
```

With the plugin installed, the rule(s) can now be added to the project's
Stylelint configuration.

```json
"plugins": ["stylelint-plugin-logical-css"],
  "rules": {
    "plugin/use-logical-properties-and-values": [true, {"severity": "warning" }],
    "plugin/use-logical-units": [true, {"severity": "warning" }]
  }
```

## Rules

Let's explore each rule to better understand what it does, and does not, allow.

### `plugin/use-logical-properties-and-values`

> A full list of physical and logical properties will be added soon.

This rule is responsible for checking both CSS properties and values. When a
physical property or value is found, it will be flagged.

#### Not Allowed

```css
.heading {
  max-width: 90ch; /* Will flag the use of "width" */
  text-align: left; /* Will flag the use of "left" */
}
```

#### Allowed

```css
.heading {
  max-inline-size: 90ch;
  text-align: start;
}
```

### `plugin/use-logical-units`

> Read about current
> [browser support for logical viewport units](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_length_viewport_percentage_units_dynamic).

This rule is responsible for checking that logical CSS units are used.
Specifically, viewport units like `vw` and `vh` which stand for viewport width
and viewport height respectively will not reflect different writing modes and
directions. Instead, this rule will enforce the logical equivalents, `vi` and
`vb`.

#### Not Allowed

```css
body {
  max-block-size: 100vh; /* Will flag the physical use of viewport "height" */
}
```

#### Allowed

```css
body {
  max-block-size: 100vb;
}
```
